## QueryDSL

The querydsl-apt dependency is an annotation processing tool (APT) — implementation of corresponding Java API that allows the processing of annotations in source files before they move on to the compilation stage. This tool generates the so-called Q-types — classes that directly relate to the entity classes of your application, but are prefixed with the letter Q. For instance, if you have a User class marked with the @Entity annotation in your application, then the generated Q-type will reside in a QUser.java source file.

The querydsl-jpa library is the Querydsl itself, designed to be used together with a JPA application.
